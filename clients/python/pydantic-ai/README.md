### MCP Client for AI Foundry

This is an MCP client written with Pydantic AI that is intended to be used for demoing the Foundry MCP Server

It comes with a helper MCP server that has tools for fetching remote URL contents that can be used in the service

For the demo, we are going to use the sample dataset to interact with the Azure AI Search tools from the MCP service.


You can run the Pydantic AI Sample code as follows:

````bash

git clone git@github.com:azure-ai-foundry/mcp-foundry.git

cd clients/python/pydantic-ai 

uv run main.py
