### VSCode Setup for Foundry MCP Server

Following the guidance from [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) you can use one of the files in the mcp config files from [the examples](./mcp-configs) to configure your VSCode in Agent Mode

The goal is to create the file .vscode/mcp.json in your workspace and you should be able to start up the MCP server
